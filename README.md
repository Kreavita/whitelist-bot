# whitelist-bot
A simple Discord Bot that allows discord users to whitelist themselves on their guilds minecraft servers, if the admins have added and configured the bot on their guild.

You need to create a `config.py` in the main directory that contains two variables:
- `RCON_PATH: str` path to the directory where `mrcon` is at
- `BOT_TOKEN: str` token for your Discord Application on [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
